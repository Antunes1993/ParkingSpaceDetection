# Parking Space Detection
Parking Spaces Occupancy Status Detection using only Image Processing

# Goals
This project has the goal to achieve an approach to detect parking spaces occupancy using only Image Processing. <br /> 
The main purpose here is propose an simple but still effective method to detect free parking spaces without need of machine learning / deep learning models. 

# Main Files
parkingSpacePicker.py - Tool to set rectangles in an image, according to the point where the user click. <br /> 
main.py - Same tool, but used in a video file. <br />
checkParkingSpace.py - Detects if an parking space selected by the user is occupied or not, using Threshold filter. <br />

# Future work intentions 
Detect parking spaces occupancy status in more challenge environments using only image processing, for example environments with presence of rain or snow. <br />
